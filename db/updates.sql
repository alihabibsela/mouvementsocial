A group of volunteers, students  themselves in secondary classes in high-level schools, used to dedicate  their after-class time to help younger pupils from nearby public  schools accomplish their homework. These teen volunteers (16-18 years  old) were probably not aware that this activity is just an element in MS  commitment that every human, especially the neediest, should have  proper attention and care. And that education is an essential part of  the human development process. The objectives have not changed since.  That&rsquo;s because a significant number of young boys and girls still are  not pursuing proper education. Some are brought out of school and forced  to start working at a very young age.
